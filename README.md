# The-Melting-Cell
<h2>description</h2>
Hi guys. If you are looking at this repository, I guess you wanted to know the source code or have some interest in melting cell. Because bot, I usually don't know it. By the way, do you know what language this bot is made of? You guys know what it is, don't you? The main reason why I didn't use discord.py is because I don't support discord.Net, but I think discord.js is more famous.
In the next heading, I'll talk about CODE.

I'm glad you're here. I'm sure you would get bored if you read such a lengthy text. Now, let's get down to business.
<h3>deploy.js</h3>
Let's take a look at deploy.js, which I think specifies a file called config.json or something like that. But it's not in this repository. But it's not in this repository, because it stores the bot's token and client id. I can't show it to you.
As you may have probably guessed from looking at the code, mimikyutale (mimishee) has almost zero knowledge of code. That's why I'm making it while looking at various websites. When I'm having trouble, I'd like to borrow the code knowledge that everyone has. I'd like to join the following discord server if you don't mind.

Thanks for reading all the way to the end. Please contact me at mimishee/The Sharp Cell#3278 if you want this bot on your server. I'm putting it on manually, so it only works occasionally, but I think you'll enjoy it a little. You can add it if you want.
